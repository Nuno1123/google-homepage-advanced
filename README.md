Google Home Page Project From The Odin Project's Hard Version[curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)
=========================

This project is a webpage recreation exercise from The Odin Project's online course on html/css - web development.

The webpage doesn't needed any functionality, just to look alike the original google.com webpage (I used the portuguese domain).
